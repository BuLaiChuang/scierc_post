"title": "This paper presents a new approach to  statistical sentence generation  in which alternative  phrases  are represented as packed sets of  trees , 
		or  forests , and then ranked statistically to choose the best one. This representation offers advantages in compactness and in the ability to represent  
		syntactic information . It also facilitates more efficient  statistical ranking  than a previous approach to  statistical generation . An efficient  ranking 
		algorithm  is described, together with experimental results showing significant improvements over simple enumeration or a  lattice-based approach .\n"
